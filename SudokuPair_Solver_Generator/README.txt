->Test Case Description:


For Q.1. :-

	 Name of file              Solution Exists         Remarks
 		
	1. ex1.csv :-   k = 3       Yes                    

	2. ex2.csv :-   k = 3       No                   This test has been included to check whether the code works for invalid inputs or not(when one or more entries in both the sudokus are common) 

	3. ex3.csv :-   k = 2       Yes

	4. ex4.csv :-   k = 5       Yes                 This file contains two empty sudokus to check how the code performs in worst case (when both sudokus are empty) 

	5. ex5.csv :-   k = 4       Yes 

	6. ex6.csv :-   k = 3       Yes                


For Q.2. :-

	There are 5 files included for this question :

	 Name of file              Remarks

 	1. k2_1.csv	k=2		

 	2. k2_2.csv	k=2 	Two files for k=2 are meant to verify the randomness of the generated sudokus.
	
	3. k3.csv	k=3

	4. k4.csv	k=4

	5. k5.csv	k=5

->The approach, implementation, limitations, and assumptions used while implementing the code has been included in the report.
->Screenshots of some tests are also included in the 'tests' folder (ExpectedOutputs.pdf).
