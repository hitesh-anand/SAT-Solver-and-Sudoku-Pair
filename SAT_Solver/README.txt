The code is contained in the "satSolver.py" file.

Simply run the file through terminal or any suitable Python IDE. After running the file, enter the path of the test case
which contains the cnf file to be tested.

If the model is unsatisfiable, the output contains a single line "UNSAT".
Else if the model is satisfiable, the output displays the model.

The test cases that we have provided are present in the 'Tests' folder. 
The expected outputs for those test cases are also present in the same folder.

The implementation details, approach, pseudocodes, function details, assumptions, 
and limitations are included in the 'CS202_A2_Report.pdf' file.

If the user wants to test some other formula, the path to that file must be given. 
Additionally, the output will be stored in the text file outfile.txt, which is present in the same directory as the .py file.
